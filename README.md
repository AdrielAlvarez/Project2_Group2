Chester is a robot that allows for a pilot to connect to it as an access point, the controls are hosted as an http server in the robot.

  - Chester composes of a tessel 2 platform running on the Johnny-Five, which is an IOT api
  - Johnny-Five allows you to interpret data to the mechanical components of chester through the controller chip and js logic
  - Chesters controls are hosted in a http server that runs on the tessel 2 board

You can find the guide used to make this robot down bellow:

### Code

The code had to be modified to fit some of the criterias needed. To start the motor.js file used to be a test code for the robots motors, it was changed so that the motorRun function could recieve logical output from the webserver.js file and translate it in to a direction and boolean for if to power on or not. 
```
//Original:
board.on("ready", () => {
  // Johnny-Five's `Motors` collection class allows
  // us to control multiple motors at once.
  const motors = new five.Motors([
    // Left Motor
    { pins: { pwm: "a5", dir: "a4", cdir: "a3" } },
    // Right Motor
    { pins: { pwm: "b5", dir: "b4", cdir: "b3" } },
  ]);
  let direction = "forward"
  let speed = 0;

  function accelerate() {
    if (speed <= 255) {
      speed += 5;
      motors[direction](speed);
      board.wait(200, accelerate);
    } else {
      flipMotorDirection();
    }
  }

  function flipMotorDirection() {
    motors.stop();
    board.wait(1000, () => {
      speed = 0;
      direction = direction === "reverse" ? "forward" : "reverse";
      console.log(`Running motors in ${direction} direction`);
      accelerate();
    });
  }
  flipMotorDirection();
});

//New:
var motorRun = function(motion, power){
    // Johnny-Five's `Motors` collection class allows
  // us to control multiple motors at once.
  var isOn = power
  let direction = motion
  let speed = 1;

  function accelerate() {
      speed = 50;
      motors[direction](speed);
  }
  if(isOn){
accelerate()
  }else{
    motors.stop()
  }
};
```


### Installation

go down to this sub directory path Project2_Grouop2/Project2_Grouop2/chester_bot

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```
$ npm install

```
- Install t2-cli as a global dependency

```
$ npm install -g t2-cli
```


### How to run

in that same directory run this command (note. you need the tessel for this to work)

```
t2 run webserver.js
```
the output should look something like this:
```

```

### Webserver

The webservers UI is not anything pretty since the goal was to have the least confusing and resource demandent interface

### Troubleshoot

during the development many issues were encountered throught the  process of making the tessel 2 to function. One issues was that the board was bricked do to a coruption of the flash during an update. This was probably the biggest roadblock since most forums trying top deal whith this issue would either not work or were not compatible with the hardware used to configure the tessel or would simply end in no solution possible. 

fortunately after much research and mentor assistance (if you know you know ðŸ‘‰) two methods were found to allow users to flash the tessel and continue on with their production(both were tested and utilised... multiple timesðŸ¤•):

###MACos and Linux:
for the mac we managed to flash the tessel running a flash.py script that would find the device, wipe the flash memory and then run the operating system back on. you can find the scrips here :
<a href='https://github.com/tessel/t2-firmware.git'>t2-firmware</a>
the os will be in the file called t2FlashOS

###Windows: 
Windows was more dificult since most of the solutions required a lot more accessabilty and harware knowledge that was just to dificult for most users at my level of programing and harware at the moment of writing this(I know thers some super genius out there probaly reading this saying "bro I learned how to do that in my freshman year of college", well we all aren't that lucky  eh?). Point aside, here is the solution to all your nightmares my beloved normal earthlings:

<a href="https://github.com/tessel/t2-cli/issues/742">Baby jesus descends for my boys</a>

###Conclusion
this project definetly has a lot of room to grow in a multitude of different paths, but there is definetly a couple recommendations:
- the motors are pretty weak so its recommended investing in something with more power to carry the weight of the whole bot
- the more juice the more the bot can work, get a better battery
- try other platforms, maybe they will be easier to set up and expand on

###and now here is a video of chester dancing to Dead or Alive - You Spin Me Round

thank you to our team for all the work put in to this project and our mentors for putting up with our crazy two week plan and powering through with us, if we can pull this of with no background in IOT or hardware than anyone can.
